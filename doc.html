        <p><strong>Forword</strong>
CAF focuses on the general case of companies migrating to the cloud. Where IT has a supportive function and is no the core of products and services offered. For ISVs on the other hand, IT has a primary function and is the significant part of the product itself.
In the ISV context we should differentiate: <strong>Internal IT</strong> (business ops) and <strong>Product</strong> (or thechnology).</p>
<h1 id="business">Business</h1>
<h2 id="itfinancecaf">IT Finance (CAF)</h2>
<p>Addresses your organization’s capability to plan, allocate, and manage the budget for IT expenses given changes introduced with the cloud services consumption model. 
A common budgeting change involves moving from capital asset expenditures and maintenance to consumption-based pricing. The move requires new skills to capture information and new processes to allocate cloud asset costs that accommodate consumption-based pricing models. You want to ensure that your organization maximizes the value of its cloud investments. Charge-back models are another common change with cloud adoption. Cloud services provide options to create very granular charge-back models. You will be able to track consumption with new details, which creates new opportunities to associate costs with results.</p>
<h3 id="forecastinfrastructureconsumption">Forecast Infrastructure Consumption</h3>
<p>Addresses on your organization’s capability to adapt to the new IT budgeting and forecast the infrastructure costs. Organizations typically rely on BI solutions to identify the trends and consumption patterns to be able to better forecast the costs.</p>
<h3 id="evaluatecommittedusagepricing">Evaluate Committed Usage Pricing</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Internal IT vs Product?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Focuses on your organization’s capability to leverage IT as a business enabler. For many organizations that have not yet migrated to the cloud, IT has devolved into simply ensuring that collaboration applications and line-of-business applications stay healthy and operational.
Cloud services provide efficiencies that reduce the need to maintain applications, enabling IT to focus on business alignment. This alignment requires new skills and both new and selectively modified processes between IT and other business and operational areas. IT teams may need new skills to gather business requirements and new processes to solve business challenges.</p>
